# üß† What This Project Is About

This is a full-stack cloud application hosted on AWS that enables users to submit a contact form via a static website. 
When users fill out the form, their submission is securely sent to a backend API hosted on EC2 and stored as JSON files in Amazon S3. 
The entire setup runs inside a custom VPC with secure architecture and performance optimization using CloudFront.

## üéØ Main Objectives

1. Host a static website (HTML/CSS/JS) on S3 with a Contact Page.  
2. Create a secure API backend using Node.js on an EC2 instance to process form submissions.  
3. Store the submitted data in Amazon S3 as individual `.json` files.  
4. Secure and scale the backend using:
   - An Application Load Balancer (ALB)
   - A custom VPC with public/private subnets and NAT
   - Proper IAM roles and S3 permissions
   - CloudFront as a secure CDN layer
5. Prevent CORS/mixed-content issues and maintain security compliance.

## üì¶ Use Case / Real-World Scenario

This project simulates a real-world use case where:

- A company website has a contact form.  
- All data submissions need to be stored securely.  
- Static frontend is fast and globally available via CDN.  
- Backend is private and secure but scalable.  
- Data is stored without a traditional database, using cost-effective object storage (S3).

## üìù Summary

This project demonstrates how to build a fully integrated, cloud-native application on AWS using core services like S3, EC2, VPC, CloudFront, and IAM.  
It‚Äôs a complete solution that combines frontend, backend, networking, and security ‚Äî all hosted reliably and scalably in the AWS ecosystem.
